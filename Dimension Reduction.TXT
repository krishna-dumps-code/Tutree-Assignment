Question: Explain dimension reduction in machine learning.

Answer:
Having the right dataset is the most important aspect of a Machine Learning problem. Demensionality Reduction in ML is the technique to reduce the number 
of dependent variables in a dataset in such  way that that the nature and the essense of the data remains intact or no relevant information gets lost.
Having lots and lots of input variables sometimes make the problem very complex to deal with, often referred to as the Curse of Dimensinality and 
can furthur lead to overfitting the model, extra memory usage and longer training time. Therefore, it is often a better choice to reduce the number 
of input features for cleaner and better understanding of data and also better generalization of the model.
Dimensionality Reduction is performed on data prior to modeling. It should be performed after data cleaning and scaling and before training a predictive model.

Dimensionality Reduction can be performed using techniques such as:
1. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms like PCA, LDA which reduces the features by projecting the features 
   in higher dimension space into a new lower dimension space.
2. Feature Selection:- There are different types of supervised or unsupervised feature selection techniques which can be used to select features which are of
   highest importance to predict the target variable. Some of them are- Statistical Testing, Feature Importance, Correlation using Heatmaps etc.
